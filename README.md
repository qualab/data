# Data Access Technology Algorithms

## Basic terms

D.A.T.A. uses objects to access data and abilities of C++ syntax to build and verify correctness of the data retrievement query.
Every object can be hold in data::object and must be variable of class derived from data::object.
Another words that should be correct:

```
data::object value = data::query(...)[0]["login"];
```

for any type requested from data source.
